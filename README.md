## What is Argo Workflows?
Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. Argo Workflows is implemented as a Kubernetes CRD (Custom Resource Definition).

* Define workflows where each step in the workflow is a container.
* Model multi-step workflows as a sequence of tasks or capture the dependencies between tasks using a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
* Easily run compute intensive jobs for machine learning or data processing in a fraction of the time using Argo Workflows on Kubernetes.
* Run CI/CD pipelines natively on Kubernetes without configuring complex software development products.

### Why Argo CD?
Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. \
Application definitions, configurations, and environments should be declarative and version controlled. Application deployment and lifecycle management should be automated, auditable, and easy to understand.

#### Core Concepts 
Let's assume you're familiar with core Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Continuous Delivery, and GitOps concepts.

- **Application** A group of Kubernetes resources as defined by a manifest. This is a Custom Resource Definition (CRD).
- **Application source type** Which Tool is used to build the application.
- **Target State** The desired state of an application, as represented by files in a Git repository.
- **Live state** The live state of that application. What pods etc are deployed.
- **Sync status** Whether or not the live state matches the target state. Is the deployed application the same as Git says it should be?
- **Sync** The process of making an application move to its target state. E.g. by applying changes to a Kubernetes cluster.
- **Sync operation status** Whether or not a sync succeeded.
- **Refresh** Compare the latest code in Git with the live state. Figure out what is different.
- **Health** The health of the application, is it running correctly? Can it serve requests?
- **Tool** A tool to create manifests from a directory of files. E.g. Kustomize or Ksonnet. See Application Source Type.
- **Configuration management tool** See **Tool**.
- **Configuration management plugin** A custom tool. 

## Argo Rollouts - Kubernetes Progressive Delivery Controller
#### What is Argo Rollouts?
Argo Rollouts is a Kubernetes controller and set of CRDs which provide advanced deployment capabilities such as blue-green, canary, canary analysis, experimentation, and progressive delivery features to Kubernetes.

Argo Rollouts (optionally) integrates with ingress controllers and service meshes, leveraging their traffic shaping abilities to gradually shift traffic to the new version during an update. Additionally, Rollouts can query and interpret metrics from various providers to verify key KPIs and drive automated promotion or rollback during an update.

### Why Argo Rollouts?Â¶
Kubernetes Deployments provides the RollingUpdate strategy which provide a basic set of safety guarantees (readiness probes) during an update. However the rolling update strategy faces many limitations:

- Few controls over the speed of the rollout
- Inability to control traffic flow to the new version
- Readiness probes are unsuitable for deeper, stress, or one-time checks
- No ability to query external metrics to verify an update
- Can halt the progression, but unable to automatically abort and rollback the update

For these reasons, in large scale high-volume production environments, a rolling update is often considered too risky of an update procedure since it provides no control over the blast radius, may rollout too aggressively, and provides no automated rollback upon failures.

### Features
- Blue-Green update strategy
- Canary update strategy
- Fine-grained, weighted traffic shifting
- Automated rollbacks and promotions
- Manual judgement
- Customizable metric queries and analysis of business KPIs
- Ingress controller integration: NGINX, ALB
- Service Mesh integration: Istio, Linkerd, SMI
- Metric provider integration: Prometheus, Wavefront, Kayenta, Web, Kubernetes Jobs
